This file contains a mockup database model as follows:
Table
 - field


customer
  - id
  - name

card
  - id (isn't the certificate the id (or the public key)?)
  - customerID (foreign key to customer table)
  - totalKm (int)
  - expiration (text field which contains a timestamp, could also be a unixtime timestamp?)
  - revocation (no boolean support, so must be stored as integer: 0=false,1=true)
  - publicKey (stored as blob)

terminal (Don't know if we need this?)
  - id
  - pubSignKey
  - secretEncKey

rentalTermLog (Probably easiest in database?)
  - timestamp
  - message
